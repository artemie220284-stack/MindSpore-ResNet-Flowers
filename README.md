A comprehensive flower classification system built with Huawei's MindSpore framework, implementing ResNet architectures for accurate flower species recognition from images.

## 🌸 Overview

This project implements a deep learning pipeline for flower classification using MindSpore, featuring:
- **ResNet-based models** (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101) for image classification
- **Oxford 102 Flower Dataset** - 102 categories of common flowers
- **Complete training pipeline** with data augmentation and validation
- **Model optimization techniques** including transfer learning and fine-tuning
- **Inference deployment** for practical applications
